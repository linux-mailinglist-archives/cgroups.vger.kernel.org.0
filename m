Do you strictly need a proper RFC or could you please test the above for
now? If you could please do the latter, and if tests look ok, I could
then put together proper changelogs etc. and propose an RFC (it would
save me some time not to do that if the above doesn't work, apologies
for not going the proper route from the start). Guess this question
applies to Qais as well. Hummm, or maybe you are actually saying that
you are indeed going to test them already, just wanted to make sure
then. :)

Thanks!
Juri
