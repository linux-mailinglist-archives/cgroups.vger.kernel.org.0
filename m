This is new - such considerations weren't described in the changelog. 
How much of a problem are these things?

Can we move these actions into the writeback completion path which
seems to be the most accurate way to do them?

Seems the intent here is mainly to prevent the warning.  If that
warning wasn't coming out, would we bother making these changes?  If
no, just kill the warning.

I don't see why.  It appears that the kworker's intended role is to
wait for writeback completion then to finish things up.  Which it does
just fine, except there's this pesky warning we get.  Therefore: kill
the pesky warning,

So expand the scope?  If hung-task doesn't have a way to suppress
inappropriate warnings then add it and use it.

mmm...  sunk cost fallacy!  Let's just opt for the best solution,
regardless of cost.
