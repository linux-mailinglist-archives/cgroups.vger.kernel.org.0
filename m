Hello,

My name is Marcus Hamper
I apologize to have contacted you this way without a direct 
relationship. There is an opportunity to collaborate with me in the 
sourcing of some materials needed by our company for production of the 
different medicines we are researching.

I'm aware that this might be totally outside your professional 
specialization, but it will be a great source for generating extra 
revenue. I  discovered a manufacturer who can supply us at a lower rate 
than our company's previous purchases. I will give you more specific 
details when/if I receive feedback from you showing interest.

Warm Regards
Marcus Hamper
Production & Control Manager,
Green Field Laboratories
Gothic House, Barker Gate,
Nottingham, NG1 1JU,
United Kingdom.
