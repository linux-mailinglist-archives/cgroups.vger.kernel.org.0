A standard for new page isolation steps like the following:
1, get_page(); #pin the page avoid be free
2, TestClearPageLRU(); #serialize other isolation, also memcg change
3, spin_lock on lru_lock; #serialize lru list access
The step 2 could be optimzed/replaced in scenarios which page is unlikely
be accessed by others.
