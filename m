I think you missed the static partitioning of resources use-case I
mentioned. The issue you are pointing exist for the system level metrics
as well i.e. a worklod looking at system metrics can't say how much they
are given but in my specific case, the workloads know they occupy the
full machine. Now we want to move such workloads to multi-tenant
environment but the resources are still statically partitioned and not
overcommitted, so effective limit will tell how much they are given.

I think here your point is why not have userspace based solution. I
think it is possible but not convenient and adds an external dependency
in the workload.

Yup, let's see more opinion on this.

Thanks Michal for your feedback.
