It's never too late, thanks for taking a look.

Good observation. I think you're right, we should probably count such
partial breaches as LOW events as well.

Note that this isn't new behavior. My patch merely moved this part
from mem_cgroup_protection():

-       if (in_low_reclaim)
-               return READ_ONCE(memcg->memory.emin);

Even before, if we retried due to just one (possibly insignificant)
cgroup below low, we'd ignore proportional reclaim and partially
breach ALL protected cgroups, while only counting a low event for the
one group that is usage < low.

I think it is. How about:

"The number of times the cgroup's memory.low-protected memory was
reclaimed in order to avoid OOM during high memory pressure."

And adding a MEMCG_LOW event to partial breaches. BTW, the comment
block above this code is also out-of-date, because it says we're
honoring memory.low on the retries, but that's not the case.

I'll prepare a follow-up patch for these 3 things as well as the more
verbose comment that Michal Hocko asked for on the retry logic.
