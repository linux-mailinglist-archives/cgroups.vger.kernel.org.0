When I look into the 20th patch, replace lru_lock, it seems this change isn't
belong there too. And I try to reduce more code changes from 20th patch, since
it's already big enough. that make it hard to do bisect if anything wrong.

So the same dilemma is here to this patch. For the bisection friendly, may it's
better to split this part out?

Thanks!

Right, will keep the BUG check here.

this code will finally be removed in next patch, but it's better in here now.
