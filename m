It's an io thread, which is kind of a hybrid - it's a kernel thread in
the sense that it never exits to userspace (ever), but it's a regular
thread in the sense that it's setup like one.

We already have this API to set the affinity based on when these were
regular kernel threads, so it needs to work with that too. As such they
are marked PF_NO_SETAFFINITY.
