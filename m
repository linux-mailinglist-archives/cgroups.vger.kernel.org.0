Ah so writer and updater are same.

This is a good point and actually in prod we are observing machines with
very active workloads, the close readers of different stats are flushing
all the subsystems even when reads are very close-by time-wise. In
addition there are users who are only reading non-memory stats and still
paying the cost of memory flushing. Please note that memory stats
flushing is the most expensive one at the moment and it does not make
sense to do flush memory stats for above two cases.

Another good point. From my observation, the cost of rstat tree
insertion is very cheap and the cost get amortized i.e. a lot of updates
within flushes such that the insertion cost is not noticeable at all, at
least in the perf traces.

The cover letter of v2 has more information on the motivation. The
main motivation is the same I descrived above i.e. many applications
(stat monitors) has to flush all the subsystem even when they are
reading different subsystem stats close-by and then there are
applications who are reading just stats of cpu or io and still have to
pay for memcg stat flushing. This series is targeting these two very
common scenarios.

Thanks Michal for your time and comments.
