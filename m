Sorry for the late reply. I have forgot to respond earlier.

We don't support that vertical exclusive check in cgroup v1 
cpuset.cpu_exclusive.

Like cpuset.cpus, cpuset.cpus.exclusive follows the same hierarchical 
rule. IOW, the CPUs in cpuset.cpus.exclusive will be ignored if they are 
not present in its ancestor nodes. The value in cpuset.cpus.exclusive 
shows the intent of the users. cpuset.cpus.exclusive.effective shows the 
real exclusive CPUs when partition is enabled. So we just can't use 
cpuset.cpus.exclusive as a replacement for cpuset.cpus.partition.

As a result, we can't actually support the vertical CPU exclusion as you 
suggest above.

I don't quite get what you want to ask here.
