Good morning,

Do you have a requirement for aluminium die-cast parts?

As a casting manufacturer, we provide you with comprehensive service - fr=
om mould design, through fabrication to delivery of the machined casting =
with dimensional and weight accuracy to your specifications.

The large range of casting machines allows us to produce from small parts=
 right up to large parts weighing 3 kg. We use automatic casting cells to=
 provide you with reproducible part quality when producing large series.

With our own Research and Development department in the German toolmaking=
 facility and three different production plants in Poland, Germany and Sw=
eden, we flexibly adapt to your needs.

A large team of specialists with decades of experience in foundry enginee=
ring will provide you with support at every stage of your order and exper=
tise on part feasibility, tool life and avoidance of quality problems.

Due to the fully automated process, small batch production becomes unprof=
itable for both us and your business, so we are keen to work with industr=
ial companies that require min. 50,000 pieces per year and with automotiv=
e partners from 100,000 pieces per year.=20

If you see an opportunity for cooperation, please send me a feedback mess=
age.


Regards
Aidan Wallace
