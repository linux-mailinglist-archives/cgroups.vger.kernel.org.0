There's some info in the commit 6db8e85c5c1f89cd0183b76dab027c81009f129f.

Strictly speaking, it's not critical if you decouple your job and cgroup
naming scheme (i.e. use the cgroup with the old name).

Do you have some numbers for this?
You can save work with not rmdir/mkdir'ing but you mention
concurrent startup specifically. And you still need to (re)setup
the cgroups after reuse and that also isn't parallelizable (at least you
need to (re)populate each reused cgroup, which is mostly under one
lock). (Even cgroup1_rename() has an exclusive section under
cgroup_mutex but it looks relatively simply.)
