Yes, I talked to Jason Gunthorpe and asked him about the usage workflow
of the pin memory controller. He tell me that his original intend is
just to have something like RLIMIT but without the quirky limitation
of the RLIMIT. It has nothing to do with sharing memory.
Share memories are only brought up during the online discussion. Â I guess
the share memory has similar reference count and facing similar challenges
on double counting.

Not sure I understand what you mean here "use the existing per-page memcg".
Do you mean you need byte counter rather than page counter?

On the other hand it is not important to understand the rest of your points.
I can move on.

Ack. That is actually the root of the share memory problem. The model
of charging to the first process does not work well for share usage.

Ack.
In that case the driver will need to hold a reference count for it, right?

OK. This is the critical usage information that I want to know. Thanks for
the explaination.

So there are two different definition of the pin page count:
1) sum(total set of pages that this memcg process issue pin ioctl on)
2) sum(total set of pined page this memcg process own a reference count on)

It seems you want 2).

If a page has three reference counts inside one memcg, e.g. map three times. 
Does the pin count three times or only once?

Multiple times to different memcgs I assume, please see the above question
regard multiple times to the same memcg.

That is more of a question for you. What is the desired behavior.
If charge the current process that perform the pin_user_pages()
works for you. Great.

I agree charge the pin count to current process memcg seems to make
sense.

Ack. That clarfy my previous question. You want definition 2)

The driver will still have a current processor. Do you mean in this case,
the current processor is not the right one to charge?
Another option can be charge to a default system/kernel smemcg or a driver
smemcg as well.

Where does the struct vm_account lives?

Set is more complicate then allow double counting the same page in the
same smemcg. Again mostly just collecting requirement from you.
