Hello All,

Since my last changes (allowing the websrv CG to use both NUMA memory
areas) the system as a whole runs reasonably without trashing and also
makes a way better use of memory.

As such it really seems that NUMA node restrictions (memory wise at
least) do not properly interact with reclaim.

Is there a way to see how memory usage is on the different NUMA nodes?

I have the impressions some reclaim was ongoing because memory
allocation was ask on one node which may have been "full" and there
only file cache was being reclaimed (in cgroups where memory.low didn't
protect it).


Thanks,
Bruno
