Subject: [PATCH mm v4 1/4] mm: prepare for swap over-high accounting and penalty calculation

Slice the memory overage calculation logic a little bit so we can
reuse it to apply a similar penalty to the swap. The logic which
accesses the memory-specific fields (use and high values) has to
be taken out of calculate_high_delay().
