Hello sir,
  I am Ambassador Jeremiah .N. Kingsley Mamabolo.
Special Representative And Head of The African Union, United Nations 
HYBRID Operation In Darfur, Sudan.
I got your contact online for a joint investment purpose. I am in United 
Kingdom London, presently. I made some money in over invoice of supply 
contract of covid 19 vaccine and other materials in the Middle East. 
10.2million U.S dollars has been mapped out for the joint venture.
for safe keeping the money has been deposited into the Bank of Africa 
until I find a reliable business partner. Because of my work and 
position in the United Nations, I can not invest or save this money in 
my country until I retired. So I need you to help me to receive it and 
to invest it into a lucrative business in your country.
I agree to offer you 10% of the total sum for your assistance to receive 
the money and to invest it in your country. After receiving the money I 
am going to quit my job and come over to your country for sharing.
More details will be giving to you as you respond to indicate your 
interest.

  Regards.
