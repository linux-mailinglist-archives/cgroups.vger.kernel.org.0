Thanks for the extensive testing. I usually perform my performance test 
on Intel hardware. I don't realize that Zen2 and arm64 perform better 
with irq on/off.

My own testing when tracking the number of times in_task() is true or 
false indicated most of the kmalloc() call is done by tasks. Only a few 
percents of the time is in_task() false. That is the reason why I 
optimize the case that in_task() is true.

The PREEMPT_DYNAMIC result is a bit surprising to me. Given the data 
points, I am not going to object to this patch then. I will try to look 
further into why this is the case when I have time.
