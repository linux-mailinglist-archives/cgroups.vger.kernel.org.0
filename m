Subject: [PATCH v13 00/18] per memcg lru lock

This is a new version which bases on linux-next, merged much suggestion
from Hugh Dickins, from compaction fix to less TestClearPageLRU and
comments reverse etc. Thank a lot, Hugh!

Johannes Weiner has suggested:
"So here is a crazy idea that may be worth exploring:

Right now, pgdat->lru_lock protects both PageLRU *and* the lruvec's
linked list.

Can we make PageLRU atomic and use it to stabilize the lru_lock
instead, and then use the lru_lock only serialize list operations?
..."

With new memcg charge path and this solution, we could isolate
LRU pages to exclusive visit them in compaction, page migration, reclaim,
memcg move_accunt, huge page split etc scenarios while keeping pages' 
memcg stable. Then possible to change per node lru locking to per memcg
lru locking. As to pagevec_lru_move_fn funcs, it would be safe to let
pages remain on lru list, lru lock could guard them for list integrity.

The patchset includes 3 parts:
1, some code cleanup and minimum optimization as a preparation.
2, use TestCleanPageLRU as page isolation's precondition
3, replace per node lru_lock with per memcg per node lru_lock

The 3rd part moves per node lru_lock into lruvec, thus bring a lru_lock for
each of memcg per node. So on a large machine, each of memcg don't
have to suffer from per node pgdat->lru_lock competition. They could go
fast with their self lru_lock

Following Daniel Jordan's suggestion, I have run 208 'dd' with on 104
containers on a 2s * 26cores * HT box with a modefied case:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/wfg/vm-scalability.git/tree/case-lru-file-readtwice

With this patchset, the readtwice performance increased about 80%
in concurrent containers.

Thanks Hugh Dickins and Konstantin Khlebnikov, they both brought this
idea 8 years ago, and others who give comments as well: Daniel Jordan, 
Mel Gorman, Shakeel Butt, Matthew Wilcox etc.

Thanks for Testing support from Intel 0day and Rong Chen, Fengguang Wu,
and Yun Wang. Hugh Dickins also shared his kbuild-swap case. Thanks!
